  <title>Noisy Wingnut Steam Hefe Weizen (All Grain)</title>
  <brewer>Matt Caron and Liz Muth</brewer>
  <style>Weizen/Weissbier</style>
  <batch quantity="5.00 gal"/>
  <notes class="recipe">This is a variation on Northern Brewer's Bavarian Hefe - same recipe, different yeast.

This was actually an oops - we used the wrong yeast. As it turns out, the result is one of our favorites.

This is the extract version.

A note on the name - we have an orange cat who, as a kitten, had big years and yowled a lot. Hence, his nickname of &quot;noisy wingnut&quot;. He's grown in to his years, but still likes to yowl at the moon.</notes>
